   <h2><u>Born Into Music</u></h2>

    <p>Growing up in Texas, I group up in a with 4 siblings who could sing or play musical instruments. My Dad was also a musician, and my mom was a singer. Music was kinda our thing. We even had a family band called...wait for it..."The Carter Children".  We sang a churchs throughout Texas, with varying memberships.  I believe that our largest audience was about 5,000 people.  So as now you can see that music has always been a friend to me.  Today as a husband and father of 2 girls, I'm continuing the tradition of creating an environment where music interest are encouraged.</p>   
    
    <h2><u>The Birth of a Musician</u></h2>

    <p>When I had the chance to join the orchestra in Junior High, I jumped at the opportunity.  Still, I couldn't choose just any instrument.  I had to pick the biggest and baddest of them all... the <u>double bass</u>.  I may have been slightly influenced by the fact that both of my older brothers, were also Bassists.    Over the years I've picked up a few more instruments along the way.  I've spent my adult life playing for others, but this album was about expressing what I hear.  I hope this album finds you well, and helps you find your groove...no matter you <i>MOOD</i>.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Chasing a Dream</u></h2>

    <p>This album is all of my musical dreams, come to life.  Finally it's a chance to play the music that I like. Now even though it's all original music, I guarantee there's something on here to pique your interest. So make room on your playlist for some new favorites. Let's Vibe!</p>
